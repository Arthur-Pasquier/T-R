  	    <h2>T&R's founder</h2>
  	    	
  	    	<p style="text-align: justify;">
  	    		Arthur Pasquier is the founder of T&R. His passion for travel and luxury hotels began in his childhood. Growing up, Arthur had the incredible opportunity to travel extensively with his family, staying in some of the world’s finest hotels. These early experiences instilled in him a deep appreciation for the art of hospitality and the transformative power of a perfect stay. Each hotel had its own unique charm and story, turning every trip into an unforgettable adventure.

		As he grew older, Arthur’s love for travel and luxury only deepened. He pursued a background in hospitality, which allowed him to understand the intricate details that make a hotel stay truly exceptional. His travels have taken him to hidden gems and luxurious retreats across the globe, each offering a unique blend of comfort, elegance, and local culture.

		Inspired by these experiences, Arthur created T&R to share his passion with fellow travelers. His goal is to guide others to discover the world’s most exquisite destinations, whether they are seeking a serene escape, an urban adventure, or anything in between. Through detailed reviews, personal stories, and insider tips, he hopes to help travelers find the perfect hotel for their next journey.
